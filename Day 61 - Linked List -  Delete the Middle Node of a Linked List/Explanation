📌Explanation:

You are given the head of a linked list. Delete the middle node, and return the head of the modified linked list.

The middle node of a linked list of size n is the ⌊n / 2⌋th node from the start using 0-based indexing, where ⌊x⌋ denotes the largest integer less than or equal to x.

For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the middle nodes are 0, 1, 1, 2, and 2, respectively.

To find the middle of linked list we use two pointers method where the first pointer moves to one position ahead and the other pointer moves to two position ahead.

First pointer will store in previous pointer for future refernce.

As second pointer reaches the middle node the previous node's next will point to first pointer next and then the head is return.

📌Test Cases:

📍Test Case 1:

•Input: head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]

•Output: [1,3,4,1,2,6]

•Explanation:

The above figure represents the given linked list. The indices of the nodes are written below.

Since n = 7, node 3 with value 7 is the middle node, which is marked in red.

We return the new list after removing this node.


📍Test Case 2:

•Input: head = [1,2,3,4]

•Output: [1,2,4]

•Explanation:

The above figure represents the given linked list.

For n = 4, node 2 with value 3 is the middle node, which is marked in red.


📍Test Case 3:

•Input: head = [2,1]

•Output: [2]

•Explanation:

The above figure represents the given linked list.

For n = 2, node 1 with value 1 is the middle node, which is marked in red.

Node 0 with value 2 is the only node remaining after removing node 1.
