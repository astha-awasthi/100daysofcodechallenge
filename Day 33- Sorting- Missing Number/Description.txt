📌 SUB TOPIC: MISSING NUMBER in the given range
📌 LANGUAGE USED: JAVA

 Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

📌 SAMPLE INPUT AND SAMPLE OUTPUT

📍TEST CASE 1:
● Input: nums = [3,0,1]
● Output: 2
● Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

📍TEST CASE 2:
● Input: nums = [0,1]
● Output: 2
● Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

📍TEST CASE 3:
● Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
● Output: 8
● Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

📌 CONSTRAINTS
● n == nums.length
● 1 <= n <= 104
● 0 <= nums[i] <= n
● All the numbers of nums are unique.

📌 SOLUTION APPROACH
We will look for the actual sum of the elements and then look for the expected sum of elements 
then missing number= expected sum- actual sum
