You may perform the following move any number of times:
Increase or decrease the position of the ith student by 1 (i.e., moving the ith student from position x to x + 1 or x - 1)

📌 TEST CASES

📍 TEST CASE 1:
• Input: seats = [3,1,5], students = [2,7,4]
• Output: 4
• Explanation: The students are moved as follows:
- The first student is moved from from position 2 to position 1 using 1 move.
- The second student is moved from from position 7 to position 5 using 2 moves.
- The third student is moved from from position 4 to position 3 using 1 move.
In total, 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 moves were used.

📍 TEST CASE 2:
• Input: seats = [4,1,5,9], students = [1,3,2,6]
• Output: 7
• Explanation: The students are moved as follows:
- The first student is not moved.

- The fourth student is moved from from position 6 to position 9 using 3 moves.
In total, 0 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 7 moves were used.

📍 TEST CASE 3:
• Input: seats = [2,2,6,6], students = [1,3,2,6]
• Output: 4
