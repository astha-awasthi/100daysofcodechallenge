In this program, we need to find out the total number of binary search trees can be constructed with n values. Below diagram shows a possible binary search tree with the key 
value as 3. So, we can construct a total of five binary search trees. When we choose node 1 as the root node, we get two trees. Similarly, one tree with 2 as root nodes and 
two trees when we select 3 as the root node.

This approach involves selecting a node recursively as the root node and create possible binary search tree.

An easy way to calculate the total number of possible binary search trees are through Catalan number:
Cn = (2n)! / n! *(n+1)!
