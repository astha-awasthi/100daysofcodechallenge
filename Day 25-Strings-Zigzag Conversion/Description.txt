📌TOPIC:STRINGS
📌SUB TOPIC: ZIGZAG CONVERSION
📌LANGUAGE USED: JAVA
The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: 
(you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)

P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:

string convert(string s, int numRows);

📌TEST CASES
TEST CASE 1:
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"

TEST CASE 2:
Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
Explanation:
P     I    N
A   L S  I G
Y A   H R
P     I

TEST CASE 3:
Input: s = "A", numRows = 1
Output: "A"
 
📌CONSTRAINTS
1 <= s.length <= 1000
s consists of English letters (lower-case and upper-case), ',' and '.'.
1 <= numRows <= 1000

📌SOLUTION APPROACH
1.First I looked at the problem and thought about how the printed pattern looked like it would be mapped out on a matrix. I wrote out the number of "main" columns and then the number of "middle" columns.

P           I         N
A      L    S     I   G
Y    A      H    R
P           I
------------------------
4     2     4     2   2(*)
The last line is 2 only because the word ends, but we can see that the pattern is 4-2-4-2-4-.... When drawing it out for numRows = 3, the pattern became

P         A         H         N
A    P    L    S    I    I    G
Y         I         R
---------------------------------
3    1    3    1    3    1    2(*)
Again we can see the pattern is 3-1-3-1-3-...

So the pattern of "main" rows to "mid" rows is n, n-2, n, n-2, ...

When I tried to build an algorithm for this pattern I got stuck. How would I make the index move up n, then down n-2 without confusing myself or missing edge cases
