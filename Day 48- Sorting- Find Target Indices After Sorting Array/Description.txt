📌 TOPIC: SORTING
📌 SUB TOPIC: Find Target Indices After Sorting Array
📌 LANGUAGE USED: JAVA

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and a target element target.
A target index is an index i such that nums[i] == target.
Return a list of the target indices of nums after sorting nums in non-decreasing order. If there are no target indices, return an empty list. The returned list must be sorted in increasing order.

📌 TEST CASES:
📍 TEST CASE 1:
• Input: nums = [1,2,5,2,3], target = 2
• Output: [1,2]
• Explanation: After sorting, nums is [1,2,2,3,5].
  The indices where nums[i] == 2 are 1 and 2.

📍 TEST CASE 2:
• Input: nums = [1,2,5,2,3], target = 3
• Output: [3]
• Explanation: After sorting, nums is [1,2,2,3,5].
  The index where nums[i] == 3 is 3.

📍 TEST CASE 3:
• Input: nums = [1,2,5,2,3], target = 5
• Output: [4]
• Explanation: After sorting, nums is [1,2,2,3,5].
  The index where nums[i] == 5 is 4.

📍 CONSTRAINTS:
• 1 <= nums.length <= 100
• 1 <= nums[i], target <= 100
