📌 TOPIC: SORTING
📌 SUB TOPIC: MERGE SORTED ARRAY
📌 LANGUAGE USED: JAVA

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1.
To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. 
nums2 has a length of n.

📌 TEST CASES

📍 TEST CASE 1:
• Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
• Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
• Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
  The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

📍 TEST CASE 2:
• Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
• Output: [1]
• Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
  The result of the merge is [1].

📍 TEST CASE 3:
• Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
• Output: [1]
• Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
  The result of the merge is [1].
  Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
  
📌 CONSTRAINTS:

• nums1.length == m + n
• nums2.length == n
• 0 <= m, n <= 200
• 1 <= m + n <= 200
• -10^9 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 10^9
