📌 TOPIC: SORTING
📌 SUB TOPIC: INTERSECTION OF TWO ARRAYS
📌 LANGUAGE USED: JAVA

Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].
Return the answer in an array.

📌 TEST CASES
📍 TEST CASE 1:
• Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3]
• Output: [4,0,1,1,3]
• Explanation: 
  For nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3). 
  For nums[1]=1 does not exist any smaller number than it.
  For nums[2]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
  For nums[3]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1). 
  For nums[4]=3 there exist three smaller numbers than it (1, 2 and 2).

📌 TEST CASE 2:
• Input: nums = [6,5,4,8]
• Output: [2,1,0,3]

📌 TEST CASE 3:
• Input: nums = [7,7,7,7]
• Output: [0,0,0,0]

📌 CONSTRAINTS:
• 2 <= nums.length <= 500
• 0 <= nums[i] <= 100
