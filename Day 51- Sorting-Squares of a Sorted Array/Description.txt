📌 QUESTION LINK:

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

📌 TEST CASES:

📍 TEST CASE 1:
• Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
• Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
• Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100]. After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].

📍 TEST CASE 2:
• Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
• Output: [4,9,9,49,121]

📌 CONSTRAINTS:
• 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
• -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
• nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

📌 SOLUTION APPROACH:
We have used sorting and then used binary search to implement this.
